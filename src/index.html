            Does it suit the brand's style? Is it user-friendly? It might sound mundane, but not everything can be
            flashy or glamorous. Every day millions of people will be landing on 404 pages. You have an opportunity to
            help
            them in a way that's useful and aesthetically pleasing. (It's up to you!)</p>

            etc.) or in a standalone product like in a car dashboard, jukebox, etc.

            Consider the controls, placements, imagery such as the artist or album cover, etc. Also, consider the device
            type that's playing the music. A dashboard in a tour bus, a smartwatch, or via a web browser. Each device
            type will have different requirements, features, and restrictions to consider.</p>

            for clothing, shoes, handmade soap, or something else?

            Consider the brand, the products offered, product views, product options, desired actions (conversions,
            product views, pricing options, etc.) and of course, the users!</p>

            Consider other elements such as a customer support info, a tracking number or receipt number, business
            location/phone number/website, pictures if needed, and any other related elements.

            Tip: The bottoms and tops of receipts are usually really underutilized. They can be great places to inform
            customers about upcoming promotions, news, ask for feedback, or promote your social media with a QR code.

            appealing and fun to use, while also being mindful of its function?

            Try to make it a realistic exercise as if it were your own dashboard... one that you need to refer to daily.
            What is the most relevant data and what's the most appropriate placement for it?</p>

            Onboarding might seem trivial, but it's the first experience your users have with your product or service. It's like the first page of a book and it can instantly excite them. If not implemented well, a bad onboarding experience could turn someone off of a brand completely.</p>
